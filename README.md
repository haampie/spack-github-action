# Actions Library

This repository contains a library of actions for creating [Popper 
workflows](https://github.com/systemslab/popper). Every subfolder 
contained in the `actions/` folder corresponds to one or more actions. 
They follow the same [Github 
actions](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-github-actions/creating-a-new-action/) 
convention, with the addition that some actions can be encapsulated in 
other runtimes, or not encapsulated at all.
